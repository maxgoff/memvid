## What is Memvid?

Memvid turns knowledge into **living memory capsules** using video compression.

Instead of storing context in vector databases, Memvid encodes memory into
**video-native formats** that are compact, fast to recall, offline-first,
and future-proof through modern codecs.

Think of Memvid as **long-term memory infrastructure for LLMs**.

---

## Why Video?

Modern video codecs (H.265, AV1, and future standards) are among the most
optimized compression systems ever built.

Memvid leverages this ecosystem to deliver:

- Massive compression for large knowledge bases  
- Deterministic, reproducible recall  
- Zero infrastructure — just files  
- Automatic improvements as codecs evolve  

---

## Core Concepts (v2)

- **Living Memory Engine**  
  Continuously append, branch, and evolve memory across sessions.

- **Capsule Context (`.mv2`)**  
  Self-contained, shareable memory capsules with rules and expiry.

- **Time-Travel Debugging**  
  Rewind, replay, or branch any memory state.

- **Smart Recall**  
  Sub-5ms local memory access with predictive caching.

- **Codec Intelligence**  
  Auto-selects and upgrades compression over time.

---

## Use Cases

- Long-running AI agents  
- Knowledge assistants  
- Offline-first AI systems  
- Auditable and debuggable AI workflows  

---

## Status

- Architecture locked  
- APIs stabilizing  
- Docs and SDKs coming soon  
- **Public v2 release: January 5, 2026**
